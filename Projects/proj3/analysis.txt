Project 3 - Analysis of Alternative Restructuring


Username: Onana1


I. For each case in which you believe trinode restructuring (or some
   other, novel idea) can be applied to more efficiently rebalance a
   CTree, provide

     (a) Description of the conditions; i.e., what must be true about
     	 the imbalanced node and its subtrees to apply trinode
     	 restructuring?  Conditions on height and size? Ancestors and
     	 descendents?

     (b) Describe how trinode restructuring would be applied in this
         case; e.g. which nodes are x, y, z?

     (c) Explain why trinode restructuring results in a size-balanced
         subtree.

     (d) Did you implement it, and did it work as expected?
  
     /// Type your answers here.  If you have multiple cases in which
     /// trinode restructuring can be applied, be sure to label
     /// the explanations for each case clearly.

     /// You may include text representations of trees to help explain.
     /// For example:
     ///                     7
     ///                   /   \
     ///                  3     12
     ///                /   \ 
     ///               1    5      

     (a).
     (b).
     (c). Trinode restructuring results in a size-balanced subtree because it moves the leftmost subtree root of the right tree into the root then takes the children of it and 
	  fits into the right position of the left tree from the root. This movement of nodes results in a tree that is follows the size balance property. 
     (d). No I did not implement it.
II. Extra Credit: Why are the trees in this project called "Chestnut
    Trees?"

    /// They are called chestnut trees because the actual chestnut tree is very balanced on both sides and it grows in a way where each side is the same or very similar to the other.
